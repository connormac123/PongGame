# Overview

For this project I am learning how to develop simple, 2-d games using the arcade library in the python launguage.  

I made a simple game of pong where you move paddles to hit a ball back and forth untill the ball moves either out of bounds to left or right. This game is currently only two players and there is no CPU A.I yet. You move the paddle on the right using "w"(up) "s" down. On the left. up arrow key(up) down arrow key(down). 

The porpose for me writing this software was to better understand object collision in programming as well as key input controls that effect the movements of the objects in the game. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}
